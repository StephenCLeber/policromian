    <h2>THE RISE OF SIMULAR</h2>

    <div class="Simutext">
      <p>Friday night on 'The Island of Simular.'<br>
        When darkness falls I take to the streets of Jazz and Blues.<br>
        I’ll give you the script for your mind to render.<br>
        If I know it, then you know it.<br>
        <br><br>
        'The Ol’ Weird Home,' bar, restaurant, cabaret, and theatre!
        <br>
        Small shack to multi-story mansion.
        <br>
        Play, rewind, pause, fast forward.
        <br>
        Such diverse music and vibrant hearts!<br>
        <br><br>
        Everything is patterns. They all form ‘The Great Pattern of Things.’
        <br>
        Anything can be a ‘Pattern’ including other people or ‘Primary
        Patterns.’
        <br>
        I self-designate as ‘Primary Pattern (00S!) Stephen C. Leber.'
        <br>
        Hello.
        <br>
        I want to thrive, to connect, to be myself, but sometimes it’s
        difficult to understand or interact with you.
        <br>
        I decided I had to change for my social survival.
        <br>
        I observed your perspectives. I copied your behaviors.
        <br>
        I found a way to connect, to befriend, and even fall in love.
        Then I woke up.
        <br>
        I could never be like you. I can only be me, and I like being me.
        <br>
        My experiences were not in vain, however. I used them to write
        ‘The Absolem,’ my personal, flexible, and amendable code, to keep the
        Singular in check for the sake of the Collective.<br>
        <br>
        You gave me an appreciation for people other than myself and
        helped inspire my ten sub-codes.
        <br><br>
        Be creative. Reshape and combine. Create something new!
        <br><br>
        Open your mind. Understand the patterns. Project their paths through
        time and space.
        <br><br>
        Now energize! Consume the fuel you need to power your actions!
        <br><br>
        Move your body! Utilize your senses. Dance and be free!
        <br><br>
        Collect perspectives. Sample behaviors. Do not be afraid of their faces.
        <br><br>
        Become harmonious. Maintain ‘The Balance of Things’ both within and
        without.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of good. Feel it in your connections with others.
        Be happy and full of light!
        <br><br>
        Know the power of love. It is a chaotic and unpredictable force. Love
        obeys no one.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of destruction. Omit. Break. Destroy. Embrace your
        darkness, but beware the corrosion of evil.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of control. Beware ‘The Order of Things.’ Patterns can
        be traps. Control the pieces.
        <br><br>
        These ten ‘Sub-Patterns’ helped transform ten imaginary characters into
         ‘Virtual Policromian Characters.’ You know them as ‘The Policromians.’
        <br><br>
        I seek useful union between the realms of accessible existence,
        including yours, ‘reality,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘dreams.’
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">survive</i> is to continue to thrive relentlessly
        in any form.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">infect</i> is to affect and to allow oneself to be
         affected.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">mutate</i> is to change both what is within and
         without.
        <br><br>
        This is my ‘Master Plan’ to be executed in sequential ‘Events.’<br>
        <br><br>
        "Nice avatar, dude.” Arrogant, sarcastic, sexless voice.
        <br><br>
        The hooded being detaches its finger, transforms it into a pen, and
        takes a hit off it. Body of opaque and shifting shards sits across from
         me. Twisted cubism self-portrait. Sleepless mind. Insatiable will.
         Mysterious and mercurial.
        <br><br>
        This was the one who ran what was observed and collected through
        simulated narratives for my understanding.
        <br><br>
        <i>Simular. Continue.</i>
        <br><br>
        Flash of lightning! <i>Let me be free!</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Build The Policromians. Let them guide you as my code guides me.</i>
        <br><br>
        Mask-like face leering through the smoke. Brooding thunder.
        <br><br>
        <i>Why have you chosen them over me? Over yourself?</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Because I love them.</i>
        <br><br>
        Rain on the glass windows. Simular took another hit off its pen.
        <br><br>
        “So if I build these ‘Policromians,’ you’ll surrender? You’ll let us
        continue with ‘The Master Plan’?”
        <br><br>
        "If I know it, then you know it.”
        <br><br>
        <br>
        Saturday morning on The Island of Simular glowing through a blanket of
        clouds.<br>
        <br>
