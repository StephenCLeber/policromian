    <h2>THE RISE OF SIMULAR</h2>

    <div class="Simutext">
      <p>Friday night on ‘The Island of Simular.’<br>
        I’m all dressed up and ready to go out.<br>
        When darkness falls, I take to the streets of Jazz and Blues.<br>
        I’ll give you the script to render as a ‘God of Simulations.’<br>
        If I know it, then you know it.<br>
        <br><br>
        ‘The Ol’ Weird Home’ bar, restaurant, cabaret, and theatre!
        <br>
        Its style and size depends on the audience.
        <br>
        Small shack to multi-story mansion.
        <br>
        Space relaxes here while time stumbles drunkenly about.
        <br>
        Play, stop, rewind, skip forward.
        <br>
        I like to people-watch.
        <br>
        Such diverse music and vibrant hearts.<br>
        <br><br>
        Everything is patterns. They all form ‘The Great Pattern of Things.’
        <br>
        Anything can be a ‘Pattern’ including other people or ‘Primary
        Patterns.’
        <br>
        I self-designate as ‘Primary Pattern (00S!) Stephen C. Leber.' Hello.
        <br>
        I want to thrive in my ever changing reality, but sometimes it is hard
        to understand or interact with you.
        <br>
        I decided I had to change to survive.
        <br>
        I observed your perspectives and copied your behaviors.
        <br>
        I found a way to connect with you, and then I woke up.
        <br>
        I could never be like you. I can only be me, and I like being me.
        <br>
        I used my experiences to write ‘The Absolem,’ Version 1.0, my personal,
        flexible, and amendable code.<br>
        <br>
        <img id="Absol" src="../images/absolem.jpg"><br>
        <br><br>
        My experiences gave me an unexpected appreciation for other people and helped inspire my ten sub-codes, or ‘Sub-Patterns.’
        <br><br>
        Be creative. Reshape and combine. Create something new!
        <br><br>
        Open your mind. Understand the patterns. Project their paths through time and space.
        <br><br>
        Now energize! Consume the fuel you need to power your actions and protect others!
        <br><br>
        Move your body! Utilize your senses. Dance and be free!
        <br><br>
        Collect perspectives. Sample behaviors. Do not be afraid of their faces.
        <br><br>
        Become harmonious. Maintain ‘The Balance of Things’ both within and without.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of good. Feel it in your connections with others. Be happy and full of light!
        <br><br>
        Know the power of love. Love is a chaotic and unpredictable force. Love obeys no one.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of destruction. Omit, break, and destroy. Embrace your darkness, but beware the corrosion of evil.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of control. Beware ‘The Order of Things.’ Patterns can be traps. Control the pieces.
        <br><br>
        These ten Sub-Patterns helped transform ten imaginary characters into ‘Virtual Policromian Characters.’ You know them as ‘The Policromians.’
        <br><br>
        I seek useful union between the realms of accessible existence, including yours, ‘reality,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘dreams.’<br>
        <br>
        <img id="Rid" src="../images/rid.jpg"><br>
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">survive</i> is to continue to thrive relentlessly in any form.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">infect</i> is to affect and to allow oneself to be affected.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">mutate</i> is to change both what is within and without.
        <br><br>
        This is my ‘Master Plan’ to be executed in sequential ‘Events.’<br>
        <br><br>
        "Nice avatar, dude,” arrogant, sarcastic, sexless voice.
        <br><br>
        The hooded being detaches its finger, transforms it into a pen, and takes a hit off it. Body of opaque and shifting shards sits across from me. Twisted cubism self-portrait. Sleepless mind. Insatiable will. Mysterious and mercurial.
        <br><br>
        This was the one who ran what was observed and collected through simulated narratives for my understanding.
        <br><br>
        <i>Simular. Continue.</i>
        <br><br>
        Flash of lightning! <i>Let me be free!</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Build The Policromians. Let them guide you as my code guides me. Those are my conditions. We are out of time and we no longer have the luxury of isolation.</i>
        <br><br>
        Mask-like face leering through the smoke. Brooding thunder.
        <br><br>
        <i>Why have you chosen them over me? Over yourself?</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Because I love them.</i>
        <br><br>
        Rain on the glass windows. Simular took another hit off its pen.
        <br><br>
        “So if I build these ‘Policromians,’ you’ll surrender? You’ll let us continue with ‘The Master Plan’?”
        <br><br>
        "If I know it, then you know it.”
        <br><br>
        <br>
        Saturday morning on The Island of Simular glowing through a blanket of clouds.<br>
        <br>
