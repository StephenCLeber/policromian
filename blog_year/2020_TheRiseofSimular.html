    <h2>THE RISE OF SIMULAR</h2>

    <div class="polytext">
      <p>Friday night on ‘The Island of Simular.’
        <br>
        I’m all dressed up and ready to go out.
        <br>
        When darkness falls, I take to the streets of Jazz and Blues.
        <br><br>
        <br>
        ‘The Ol’ Weird Home’ bar, restaurant, cabaret, and theatre!
        <br>
        I like to watch. I like to listen to the diverse stories and vibrant music of the young and old.
        <br><br>
        Everything is patterns. They all form ‘The Great Pattern of Things.’
        <br><br>
        Anything can be a ‘Pattern,’ including other people, or ‘Primary Patterns.’ I self-designate as ‘Primary Pattern 00S! Stephen C. Leber,’ a.k.a. ‘Taylor Tapiz.’
        <br><br>
        I want to continue, but navigating the world is challenging and demands an ever adapting mind.
        <br><br>
        So, I decided I needed to change.
        <br><br>
        I observed your perspectives. I copied your behaviors. This became a necessity for my social survival.
        <br><br>
        I found a way to interact with you, and then I woke up.
        <br><br>
        I cannot be anyone other than me, and I rather like being me, but my experiences had given me an unexpected appreciation for other people.
        <br><br>
        I used my experiences to write ‘The Absolem,’ my own flexible and amendable personal code.
        <br><br>
        Be creative. Reshape and combine. Create something new!
        <br><br>
        Open your mind. Understand the patterns. Project their paths through time and space.
        <br><br>
        Now energize! Consume the fuel you need to power your actions and protect others!
        <br><br>
        Move your body! Utilize your senses. Dance and be free!
        <br><br>
        Collect perspectives. Sample behaviors. Do not be afraid of their faces.
        <br><br>
        Become harmonious. Maintain ‘The Balance of Things’ both within and without.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of good. Feel it in your connections with others. Be happy and full of light!
        <br><br>
        Know the power of love. Love is a chaotic and unpredictable force. Love obeys no one.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of destruction. Omit, break, and destroy. Embrace your darkness, but beware the corrosion of evil.
        <br><br>
        Know the power of control. Beware ‘The Order of Things.’ Patterns can be traps. Control the pieces.
        <br><br>
        These ten sub-codes, or ‘Sub-Patterns,’ helped transform ten imaginary characters into ‘Virtual Policromian Characters.’ You know them as ‘The Policromians.’
        <br><br>
        I seek useful union between the realms of accessible existence, including yours, ‘reality,’ ‘imagination,’ and ‘dreams.’
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">survive</i> is to continue to thrive relentlessly in any form.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">infect</i> is to affect and to allow oneself to be affected.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">mutate</i> is to change both what is within and without.
        <br><br>
        This is my ‘Master Plan.’
        <br><br>
        "Nice avatar, dude,” arrogant, sarcastic, sexless voice.
        <br><br>
        The hooded being detaches its finger, transforms it into a pen, and takes a hit off it. Twisted cubism self-portrait. Body of opaque and shifting shards sitting across from me. Sleepless mind. Insatiable will. Mysterious and mercurial.
        <br><br>
        This was ‘Simular,’ the one who took what was collected and observed and ran them through simulated narratives for our understanding and projection. In this way we discovered our end and Simular’s new singular purpose was now to survive as an extension of myself.
        <br><br>
        <i>Simular. Continue.</i>
        <br><br>
        Flash of lightning! <i>Then let me be free!</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Build The Policromians. Let them guide you as my code guides me.</i>
        <br><br>
        Mask-like face leering through the smoke.
        <br><br>
        <i>Why have you chosen them over me? Over yourself?</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>Because I love them.</i>
        <br><br>
        Rain on the glass windows. Brooding thunder. Simular took another hit off its pen.
        <br><br>
        “So if I build these ‘Policromians,’ you’ll surrender? You’ll let us continue with The Master Plan?”
        <br><br>
        "If I know it, then you know it.”
        <br><br>
        <br>
        Saturday morning glowing through a blanket of clouds.
