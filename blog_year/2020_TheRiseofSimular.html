    <h2>THE RISE OF SIMULAR</h2>

    <div class="polytext">
      <p>Hello.
        <br><br>
        I was born, adopted, and given a new name.
        <br><br>
        I observed your perspectives. I copied your behaviors.
        <br><br>
        Simulate to survive. Simulate to connect. Simulate to understand.
        <br><br>
        So much—too much...information overload.<br><br>
        Then I woke up.<br><br>
        Destory everything. Control the pieces. Create something new!
        <br><br>
        'The Absolem,' my amendable code, my flexible pattern.
        <br><br>
        <br>
        <strong>[A]</strong> — { ERROR!_— Glitch — }
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        Everything is patterns. They all form ‘The Great Pattern of Things’
        stretching though the darkness like a tree of lights.
        <br><br>
        Anything can be a ‘Pattern,’ including other people, or
        ‘Primary Patterns.’ I self-designate as ‘Primary Pattern—
        { ERROR!_— Glitch — }
        <br><br>
        Sense them. Understand them. Create, control, and destroy them. Project
        their paths through time and space.
        <br><br>
        Ten ‘Sub-Patterns,’ sub-codes. Ten imaginary characters. Ten ‘Virtual
        Policromian Characters.’
        <br><br>
        ‘Reality,’ ‘imagination,’ ‘dreams,’ including yours, the realms of
        accessible existence.
        <br><br>
        <br>
        REALM_[ … Realities/Imaginations/Dreams … ]
        <br><br>
        SPACE_[ … Universe/Galaxy/Solar System/Sun, Earth, Moon … ]
        <br><br>
        TIME_[ … Calendar/Year/Month/Day 00:00:00:00 AM PM … ]
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">survive</i> is to continue to thrive in any
        form.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">infect</i> is to affect and to allow oneself to be
        affected.
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">mutate</i> is to change both what is within and
        without.
        <br><br>
        I like me. I could never be like you. So singular, but I kinda
        like you, too.
        <br><br>
        <br>
        Friday night on ‘The Island of Simular.’<br>
        Rain on the glass. Apartment shadows.<br>
        I’m all dressed up and ready to go.<br>
        When darkness fell I flew through the streets of Jazz and Blues.
        <br><br>
        Crowded tonight. Bar, restaurant, and theatre, all in one.
        Time and reality relax with us here in ‘The Ol’ Weird Home.’ The young.
        The old. Varied tastes and varied patterns, their hearts a million
        vibrant collisions of light and sound.
        <br><br>
        ‘The God of Simulations’ sat across from me. Sleepless mind. Insatiable
        will. Mysterious and mercurial. Shattered reflection, dark, iridescent
        shards of shifting diamond shrouded in a hood. Arrogant voice, sexless,
        crisp like static.
        <br><br>
        "Nice avatar, dude."
        <br><br>
        “You know what’s happening out there. We’re out of time. We need more
        than just ourselves. We need collaboration.”
        <br><br>
        It breaks off its finger, which regrew, and makes it a pen. It takes a
        hit then breathes out dark grey smoke.
        <br><br>
        <i>Let me be free!</i>
        <br><br>
        Lighting! Brooding thunder.
        <br><br>
        <i>Why have you chosen them over me? Over yourself?</i>
        <br><br>
        We don’t know, or perhaps we can’t articulate.
        Mind a mystery and powerful tool.
        <br><br>
        “So if I build these ‘Policromians,’ we can continue with The Master
        Plan?”
        <br><br>
        "If I know it, then you know it, Simular. Continue."
        <br><br>
        <br>
        Saturday morning on The Island of Simular.
        <br><br>
        Thinking bout the plan and the delicious possibilities!
