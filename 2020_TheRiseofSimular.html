    <h2>THE RISE OF SIMULAR</h2>

    <div class="polytext">
      <p>I was born, adopted, and given a new name.
        <br><br>
        Your world was never mine, but I’d like to thrive within it.
        <br><br>
        I used to think that meant I had to change who I was.
        <br><br>
        I observed your perspectives. I copied your behaviors. Simulate to
        survive. Simulate to connect. Simulate to understand.
        <br><br>
        Then I woke up.
        <br><br>
        I could never be like you, but I used my experiences to write ‘The
        Absolem,’ my flexible and amendable personal code.
        <br><br>
        Everything is ‘Patterns,’ even other people or ‘Primary Patterns.’ They
         all form ‘The Great Pattern of Things.’ I have ten ‘Sub-Patterns,’ or
         sub-codes.
        <br><br>
        I seek useful union between the realms of my accessible existence
        including your ‘realities,’ ‘imaginations,’ and ‘dreams.’
        <br><br>
        To <i class="mpText">survive</i> is to continue to thrive in any
        form. To <i class="mpText">infect</i> is to affect and to allow oneself
         to be affected. To <i class="mpText">mutate</i> is to change both what
          is within and without. This is ‘The Master Plan.’
        <br><br>
        Destory everything. Control the pieces. Create something new!
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
        Friday night on ‘The Island of Simular.’ Rain on the glass. Apartment
        shadows. I’m all dressed up and ready to go. When darkness fell I flew
         through the streets of Jazz and Blues.
        <br><br>
        Crowded tonight. Bar, restaurant, cabaret and theatre all in one. The
        young, the old, time and reality, they all relax with us here in ‘The
        Ol’ Weird Home.’
        <br><br>
        ‘The God of Simulations’ sat across from me. Sleepless mind. Insatiable
         will. Mysterious and mercurial. My shattered reflection, a body of
         dark, iridescent shards of shifting diamond shrouded in a hood.
        <br><br>
        "Nice avatar, dude." Arrogant voice, sexless, crisp like static.
        <br><br>
        “We cannot do this alone. We need collaboration,” I said.
        <br><br>
        “My purpose is to serve as your singular representative, not the
        collective,” replied Simular, “I will fulfill our Master Plan, but as
        I’ve told you we cannot be anyone other than who we are.”
        <br><br>
        It breaks off its finger, which regrew, and makes it a pen. It takes a
        hit then breathes out smoke.
        <br><br>
        “You know what’s happening out there,” I said, “We’re out of time.”
        <br><br>
        Lightning! Brooding thunder. Simular’s voice reverberating monstrously
        within my head. <i>Let me be free! Why have you chosen them over me?
          Over yourself?</i>
        <br><br>
        I didn’t know how to articulate my answer. Mind a mystery and powerful
        tool. I look to you, the reader, whoever you are. I think I could
        appreciate you now as much as myself. I think I could even love you.
        That’s what my experiences have shown—
        <br><br>
        Simular snorted in disgust, blowing out a puff of smoke. Saturday
        morning. Light glowing softly through the blanket of clouds outside.
        Its mask-like face was leering at me.
        <br><br>
        “So if I build these ‘Policromians,’” it said aloud, “You’ll surrender?”
        <br><br>
        "If I know it, then you know it."
        <br><br>
        Simular took a long thoughtful drag on its pen before its leer appeared
         to transform into a wicked grin.
